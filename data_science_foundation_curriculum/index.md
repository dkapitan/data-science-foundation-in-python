# Why this JupyterBook?

Whilst teaching data science courses at [Jheronimus Academy of Data Science](https://jads.nl), I often get requests to show _how_ to apply the theory. Given that there is a lot of great content avaialable in the creative commons, I have tried to curate, combine and remix these into an integrated online book for ease of use.

This foundational data science curriculum based on the following materials:

- [Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R](https://statlearning.com) by James, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani (second edition, 2021)
- [Altair Visualization Curriculum](https://uwdata.github.io/visualization-curriculum/intro.html), developed at the University of Washington by Jeffrey Heer, Dominik Moritz, Jake VanderPlas, and Brock Craft
- [Forecasting: Principles and Practice](https://otexts.com/fpp3/) by Rob J Hyndman and George Athanasopoulos (third edition, 2021)
- [Advanced NLP with spaCy](https://course.spacy.io/en/)
- [Interpretable Machine Learning](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/) by Christoph Molnar (2021)

I have added my own example notebooks and those of others that I have found useful and fitting within this curriculum. Attributions and links are provided in each section separately.
