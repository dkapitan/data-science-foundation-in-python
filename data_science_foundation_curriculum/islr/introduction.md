# Introduction to ISLRv2

## An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R, Second Edition (ISLRv2)

The first edition of ISLR (2013) quickly became one of the standard textbooks in the field. The second edition makes it even harder to beat in terms of a comprehensive introduction to statistical learning, adding more techniques including deep learning, naive Bayes and matrix completion. I think it is one of the best books because it covers just enough maths to understand the underlying princples, whilst providing an intuitive understanding through visual explanations. The book is freely available on [https://statlearning.com](https://statlearning.com), although I warmly recommend you buy as a desk reference.

## Suggested study plan

- Read the book, covering at least chapters 1 to 6. Depending on your interest c.q. preference of type of methods you plan to use, you can selectively go through chapters 7 to 13
- Try a handful of Labs, to gain experience in training models of your choice
- Try any of the coding exercises, to become more fluent in your daily work

Example solutions to Labs and exercises are taken from [Jordi Warmenhoven's repository](https://github.com/JWarmenhoven/ISLR-python), based on the first edition. More examples and solutions will be added over time.
