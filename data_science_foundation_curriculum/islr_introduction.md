# Introduction to Statistical Learning (in Python)

## Why ISLR (or actually: ISLP)?

Some words why I think it's one of the best books:

- Just enough maths to understand the underlying princples
- Visual explanations with graphs and diagrams
- Book freely available, although I warmly recommend you to buy it as a desk reference
