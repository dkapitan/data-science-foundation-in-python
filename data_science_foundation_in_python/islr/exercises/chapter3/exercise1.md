# Exercise 3.1

The t-statistics computed on Table 3.4 are computed individually for each coefficient since they are independent variables. Accordingly, there are 4 null hypotheses that we are testing:

1. $H_0$ for "TV": **in the presence of** Radio and Newspaper ads (and in addition to the intercept), there is no relationship between TV and Sales;
2. $H_0$ for "Radio": **in the presence of** TV and Newspaper ads (and in addition to the intercept), there is no relationship between Radio and Sales;
3. $H_0$ for "Newspaper": **in the presence of** TV and Radio ads (and in addition to the intercept), there is no relationship between Newspaper and Sales;
4. $H_0$ for the intercept: **in the absence of** TV, Radio and Newspaper ads, Sales are zero;

versus the 4 corresponding alternative hypotheses:

$H_a$: There is some relationship between TV/Radio/Newspaper and Sales, or Sales are non-zero in the absence of the other variables.

<br><br>
Mathematically, this can be written as

$H_0:$ $\beta_i=0$, for $i = 0,1,2,3$,

versus the 4 corresponding alternative hypotheses

$H_a:$ $\beta_i\neq0$, for $i = 0,1,2,3$.

As can been seen on Table 3.4 (and below with Python), for all the variables the p-value is practically zero, except for *Newspaper* for which it is very high, namely .86, much larger than the typical confidence levels, 0.05, 0.01 and 0.001.  Given the t-statistics and the p-values we can reject the null hypothesis for the intercept, TV and Radio, but not for Newspaper.

This means that we can conclude that **there is a relationship between TV and Sales, and between Radio and Sales**. Also rejecting $\beta_0=0$, allows us to conclude that **in the absence of TV, Radio and Newspaper, Sales are non-zero**. Not being able to reject the null hypothesis $\beta_{Newspaper}=0$, suggests that there is indeed **no relationship between Newspaper and Sales, in the presence of TV and Radio**.

## Additional comment

At a 5% p-value, there would be a 19% chance of having one appear as significant out of 3 variables, even if there was no relationship for all of them.
