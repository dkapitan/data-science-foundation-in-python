# Exercise 2.2

## (a) CEO salary

**Regression**, since the variable we are interested in, CEO salary, is quantitative.
Since we want to understand the factors affecting CEO salary we are most interested in **inference**.
The number of predictors is 3, and the sample size is 500 **(p=3, n=500)**.

## (b) New product launch: success or failure?

**Classification**, because we are studying the outcome of the launch of a new product, which we are representing in one of two categories: success or failure.
In this case we wish to know whether a new launch will be a success or a failure more than understand why, so we are more interested in **prediction**.
The number of predictors is 13, and the sample size is 20 **(p=13, n=20)**.

## (c) Change in the US dollar

**Regression**, since the variable we want to predict is a real number, and we are more interested in **prediction**.
The number of predictors is 3, and the sample size is 52 **(p=3, n=52)**.
