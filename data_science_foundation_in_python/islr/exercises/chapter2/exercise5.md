# Exercise 2.5


## A very flexible approach (versus a less flexible)

### Advantages

 - Less bias.
 - Given enough data, better results.
 
### Disadvantages

 - More risk of overfitting.  
 - Harder to train.
 - Longer to train.
 - Computational more demanding.
 - Less clear interpretability.
 

## When is one approach preferable?

### More flexible

 - Large sample size and small number of predictors.
 - Non-linear relationship between the predictors and response.
 
### Less flexible

 - Small sample size and large number of predictors.
 - High variance of the error terms.
