The formulas for the odds in terms of the probability of a certain event, and vice-versa, are the following:

$$ odds = \frac{p}{1-p},$$

$$ p = \frac{odds}{1+odds}.$$

## (a)

With odds=0.37, we get

$$p = \frac{0.37}{1 + 0.37} \approx 0.27.$$

## (b)

Similarly, if p = 0.16, we have

$$odds = \frac{0.16}{1-0.16} \approx 0.19.$$
