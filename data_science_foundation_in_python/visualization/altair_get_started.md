# Getting Started with Altair

The following section includes a data visualization curriculum of interactive notebooks, using [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) and [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/). This book contains a series of Python-based Jupyter notebooks, a corresponding set of JavaScript notebooks are available online on [Observable](https://observablehq.com/@uwdata/data-visualization-curriculum).

## Local Installation

1. [Install Altair and a notebook environment](https://altair-viz.github.io/getting_started/installation.html). The most recent versions of these notebooks use _Altair version 4_.
2. Download the notebooks from the [releases page](https://github.com/uwdata/visualization-curriculum/releases). Typically you will want to use the most recent release.  (If you wish to use notebooks for Altair version 3, download the [Altair v3.2 release](https://github.com/uwdata/visualization-curriculum/releases/tag/altair-v3).)
3. Open the notebooks in your local notebook environment. For example, if you have JupyterLab installed (v1.0 or higher is required), run `jupyter lab` within the directory containing the notebooks.

Depending on your programming environment (and whether or not you have a live internet connection), you may want to specify a particular [renderer](https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/display_frontends.html) for Altair.
