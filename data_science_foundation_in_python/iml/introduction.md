# Introduction to IML

## Interpretable Machine Learning (IML)

[Christoph Molnar](https://christophm.github.io/) is a German a data scientist and PhD candidate in interpretable machine learning. He recommends this book to practitioners who want an overview of techniques to make their machine learning models more interpretable. 

To get started with interpretable machine learning :

- Read the lectures notes [here](https://github.com/jads-nl/data-science-foundation-curriculum/blob/main/data_science_foundation_curriculum/iml/interpretable-machine-learning.pdf)
- Read the book, at least covering the basics in chapters 1 to 6
- Go through the Kaggle online course on [Machine Learning Explainability](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/machine-learning-explainability)
- Go through some of the examples provided in the next section
- Try to apply a couple of the techniques in your project
