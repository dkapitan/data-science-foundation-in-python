# Exercise 6.2

# (a)

* <b>(i)</b> False. Lasso reduces the number of variables, thus is less flexible.
* <b>(ii)</b> False. Same justification as in (i).
* <b>(iii)</b> True. 
* <b>(iv)</b> False. In general, lasso reduces variance and increases bias. Reduction in variance should compensate increasement in bias.

# (b)

Same answer as above.

# (c)

* <b>(i)</b> False. In general, non-linear methods reduce bias and increase variance. Reduction in bias should be compensate increasement in variance.
* <b>(ii)</b> True.
* <b>(iii)</b> False. Non-linear methods are more flexible because they accomodate to the data. Unlike least squares, non-linear methods don't assume a parametrized relationship between the predictors and the response.
* <b>(iv)</b> False. Same justification as in (iii).
