# Hands-on Machine Learning with Aurélien Géron

## Hands-on Machine Learning in Python with Scikit-Learn, Keras and Tensorflow, Second Edition

The lion's share of this chapter is based on the excellent book written by Aurélien Géron. Besides the book itself - which is warmly recommended as a desk reference - the author has graciously provided a [repository of notebooks with solutions and exercises on GitHub](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2). These are included here almost entirely, only leaving out the introductory notebooks on Python.

## Notebooks per chapter
 
Each chapter of the book comes with a separate notebook. Chapter 1 through 9 cover scikit-learn, i.e. the most commonly used regression and classification algorithms. Chapter 10 through 19 cover deep learning witk Keras and Tensorflow.
 
## Extra notebooks
 
If you require a more insight into the underlying principles of machine learning, these extra notebooks cover a selection of mathematical topics.
